## Topic of the Day: Adjective 📘

An adjective is a word that describes or qualifies a noun or pronoun.  

It tells us how someone or something is — such as its quality, size, color, shape, emotion, number, etc.

## Degrees of Comparison 🔍

### Definition
- The degrees of comparison refer to the forms of an adjective used when we want to express differences in quality, quantity, or relation between nouns.  
  Essentially, they allow us to compare things.

### The Three Principal Degrees

**A. The Positive Degree**  
- **Purpose:** This is the base form of the adjective.  
- It is used when describing a single entity (one object, person, or place) without making any comparison to others.  
- **Example:**  
  - She has a big house. (Here, the focus is only on the size of one specific house.)

**B. The Comparative Degree**  
- **Purpose:** This degree signifies a greater degree of the quality than the Positive degree.  
- It is specifically used when comparing exactly two objects, people, or places.  
- **Usage Rule:** It is almost always followed by the conjunction "than".  
- **Example:**  
  - Her house is bigger than my house. (Comparing two houses.)

**C. The Superlative Degree**  
- **Purpose:** This degree signifies the highest or greatest degree of the quality.  
- It is used when comparing more than two objects, people, or places, identifying the one that stands out.  
- **Usage Rule:** It is almost always preceded by the definite article "the".  
- **Example:**  
  - His house is the biggest of all. (Comparing one house against an entire group.)

| Degree      | Use                                                  | Example                            |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Positive    | Refers to one object, person, or place without comparison. | She has a big house.              |
| Comparative | Compares two objects, people, or places.            | Her house is bigger than my house.|
| Superlative | Compares more than two objects, people, or places (the greatest degree). | His house is the biggest of all.  |

## Rules for Formation 🛠

The base adjective is the Positive Degree. The Comparative and Superlative degrees are formed as follows:

- **Most One/Two Syllable Words:** Add -er (Comparative) and -est (Superlative).  
  - Dull → duller → dullest  
  - Tall → taller → tallest  
  - Small → smaller → smallest  
  - Fast → faster → fastest  
  - Short → shorter → shortest  
  - Long → longer → longest

- **Words ending in 'e':** Add only -r (Comparative) and -st (Superlative).  
  - Large → larger → largest  
  - Fine → finer → finest  
  - Wise → wiser → wisest  
  - Close → closer → closest  
  - Nice → nicer → nicest

- **Words ending in Consonant + 'y':** Drop the 'y' and add -ier (Comparative) and -iest (Superlative).  
  - Happy → happier → happiest  
  - Lucky → luckier → luckiest  
  - Busy → busier → busiest  
  - Easy → easier → easiest  
  - Funny → funnier → funniest

- **One-Syllable words ending in Vowel + Consonant:** Double the final consonant, then add -er and -est.  
  - Red → redder → reddest  
  - Big → bigger → biggest  
  - Hot → hotter → hottest  
  - Thin → thinner → thinnest  
  - Fat → fatter → fattest

- **Long Words (Two or More Syllables):** Add more (Comparative) and most (Superlative) before the adjective.  
  - Useful → more useful → most useful  
  - Careful → more careful → most careful  
  - Beautiful → more beautiful → most beautiful  
  - Intelligent → more intelligent → most intelligent

## Irregular Degrees 🌟

  - Good → better → best  
  - Bad → worse → worst  
  - Little → less → least  
  - Much / Many → more → most  
  - Far → farther / further → farthest / furthest  
  - Old → older / elder → oldest / eldest  
  - Late → later → latest  
  - Well (adverb) → better → best

## Mind the Topic 💡

✓ **Usage Notes:**  
  - Use than with the Comparative degree.  
    Example: Mohan is shorter than Ricky.  
  - Use the with the Superlative degree.  
    Example: Falguni is the shortest girl in her class.

✓ **Syllable**  
A syllable is a single sound unit in a word.  
Every syllable has one vowel sound (a, e, i, o, u or vowel sound like a, ai, oo, etc.).  

**Simple Definition**  
A syllable is a beat of sound in a word.

### Answers + Explanations 💡

1. My house is (big) **bigger** than yours.  
   **Explanation:** “Big” is a one-syllable adjective, so we add -er → bigger for comparison between two houses.

2. This flower is (beautiful) **more beautiful** than that one.  
   **Explanation:** “Beautiful” has three syllables, so we use more for the comparative → more beautiful.

3. This is the (interesting) **most interesting** book I have ever read.  
   **Explanation:** “Interesting” is a long adjective, so we use most for the superlative → most interesting. We use superlative because we compare it with all other books read.

4. Non-smokers usually live (long) **longer** than smokers.  
   **Explanation:** “Long” is a one-syllable adjective, so comparative is formed by adding -er → longer.

5. Which is the (dangerous) **most dangerous** animal in the world?  
   **Explanation:** “Dangerous” is a three-syllable adjective → take most for superlative → most dangerous. Also superlative is used because we compare all animals in the world.

6. A holiday by the sea is (good) **better** than a holiday in the mountains.  
   **Explanation:** “Good” is an irregular adjective: good → better → best. Here, comparison of two holidays → better.

7. It is strange but often a coke is (expensive) **more expensive** than a beer.  
   **Explanation:** “Expensive” is a three-syllable adjective → use more → more expensive.

8. Who is the (rich) **richest** woman on earth?  
   **Explanation:** “Rich” is one syllable, so superlative takes -est → richest. Also “the” + superlative is needed because we compare all women on earth.

9. The weather this summer is even (bad) **worse** than last summer.  
   **Explanation:** “Bad” is irregular: bad → worse → worst. Comparison of two summers → worse.

10. He was the (clever) **cleverest** thief of all.  
    **Explanation:** “Clever” is a two-syllable word that commonly takes -er/-est. Superlative of clever → cleverest. Used because we compare him with all other thieves.
