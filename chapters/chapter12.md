## 📖 Topic of the Day: Homophones, Homographs, Homonyms

### 1. Homophones
**✅ Definition:** Words that sound the same but have different meanings — and often different spellings.  

**✅ Key Points:**  
- Same pronunciation, different meaning/spelling.  
- The suffix "-phone" means "sound", helping you remember that homophones are about pronunciation.

**✅ Examples:**  
- Two, to, too  
- Write and right  
- Sea and see  
- Mail / Male  
- Berry / Bury  
- Be / Bee  
- Night / Knight  

🔹 Example sentence: "I want to see the sea."

### 2. Homographs
**✅ Definition:** Words that are spelled the same but have different meanings — and pronounced differently.  

**✅ Key Points:**  
- Same spelling, different meaning/pronunciation.  
- The suffix "-graph" means "writing", so homographs are about spelling.

**✅ Examples:**  
- Lead (to guide) / Lead (a metal) → different pronunciation  
- Tear (rip) / Tear (from the eye)  
- Bow (to bend forward) / Bow (used with arrows)  
- Wind (air) / Wind (to twist)  
- Live (to exist) / Live (happening now)  

🔹 Example sentence: "She shed a tear over the tear in her dress."

### 3. Homonyms
**✅ Definition:** Words that are spelled the same, sound the same, but have different meanings.  

**✅ Key Points:**  
- Same spelling, pronunciation but different meaning.  
- "Homonym" is sometimes used broadly to refer to both homophones and homographs.

**✅ Examples:**  
- Bat (animal) / Bat (sports)  
- Left (direction) / Left (past of leave)  
- Right (correct) / Right (direction)  
- Letter (alphabet) / Letter (mail)
