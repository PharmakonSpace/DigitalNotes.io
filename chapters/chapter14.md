## ⏳ Spotlight Theme: “Time”

Time is priceless—what is the value of a year, a month, an hour, a minute, a second?  
*The above one is not a question to be asked — it is a reminder to bring attention to the true value of time.*

### ⏳ Time Is Priceless
The worth of time is felt most by those who’ve lost it.

- Every tick of the clock carries a story.  
- Every passing moment holds a lesson.  
- Every moment counts; once it’s gone, it never returns.

### Thought Exercise

**Question:**  
You get ₹84,600 every day, and you have to spend it all—nothing can be saved for tomorrow since you’ll get another ₹84,600. How would you spend it?

**Reflection:**  
- Unlike money, time cannot be earned back. Each day gives us 86,400 seconds — how we use them defines the quality of our life.  
- True worth of time is often revealed through loss or regret — a failed exam, a missed opportunity, a life cut short. Every second counts, especially when it’s almost gone.

### 🕰️ Key Notes: Understanding the Priceless Value of Time

1. **Time is the most valuable resource**  
   -It’s free, yet once lost, it can never be regained.  
   -Money can be earned back — time cannot.

2. **The illusion of having enough time**  
   ➡️Buddha said: “The biggest mistake we make is thinking we have time.”  
   ➡️Time is free but priceless —    
     -You can’t own it, but you can use it.  
     -You can’t keep it, but you can spend it.  
     -Once lost, you can never get it back.

3. **86,400 seconds a day**  
   -How we spend these seconds determines our success and happiness.

4. **Time vs. Money**  
   -People trade time for money, yet time is infinitely more valuable.  
   -You can save or invest money — but not time.

5. **True value revealed through loss**  
   -A failed exam, a missed opportunity, or an accident often makes us realize time’s worth.  
   -Every second, minute, or hour can change a life.

6. **Relationships and regret**  
   -We often let people or situations waste our time.  
   -Value your loved ones and moments before they become memories.

7. **The inner battle**  
   ➡️Inside each of us are two voices:  
     -🕊️ **Voice of Growth:** Uplifts, expands, and pushes us to reach our potential.  
     -⚫ **Voice of Limitation:** Holds us back, promotes laziness, fear, and comfort.  
   ➡️The voice that wins is the one we choose to listen to and feed every day.

8. **Lessons from life and art**  
   ➡️Shakespeare showed that time feels different depending on emotion:  
     -Very slow for those who want.  
     -Very fast for those who are scared.  
     -Very long for those who are sad.  
     -Very short for those who celebrate.  
     -But for those who love — time is eternal.  
   ➡️Our perception of time reflects our state of mind.

9. **Live meaningfully**  
   -Time is life — how we use it shapes who we become.

> “You are the pilot of your own time — make every second count.”
