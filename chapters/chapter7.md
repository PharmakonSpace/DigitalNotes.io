## Difference Between GD and Debate

👉 **GD is collaborative, while debate is competitive.**

### 👥💬 GD = Discussion
- Everyone works together, shares ideas, and builds a collective viewpoint.  
- Aim is understanding, not winning

### 🆚🗣️ Debate = Argument
- Two sides argue against each other to prove which side is stronger.  
- Aim is to prove your point
