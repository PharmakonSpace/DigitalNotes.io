## 📝 Simple Past Tense

The Simple Past Tense is used to talk about actions or events that happened in the past and are now completed.

**Simple past is used:**

• To narrate past events.  
👉 Yesterday, I went to the market, met my old friend, and we talked for hours.  
👉 All the actions (went, met, talked) are completed past actions, so we use simple past.

• Making it useful in storytelling  
👉 The prince saw a dragon, drew his sword, and fought bravely.  
👉 Each verb shows a past action in a story sequence — perfect for narration.

• Sharing experiences.  
👉 I visited Goa last year. It was a beautiful place, and I enjoyed the beaches a lot.  
👉 The speaker is recalling a past experience.  
All verbs — visited, was, enjoyed — show completed actions in the past.

## ✅ Formula

• **`Subject + V2`**

---

### 🔹 Regular Verbs

• Formed by adding “-ed” to the base verb.  
• Examples:  
👉 watch → watched  
👉 walk → walked  
👉 play → played

• The same past form is used for all subjects (I, you, he, she, we, they).

**Examples:**

👉 I walked my dog yesterday.  
👉 She played the guitar at my party last month.  
👉 The students studied last night.

---

### 🔹 Irregular Verbs

• Do not follow the “-ed” rule.  
• They change into a different form in the past.

**Examples:**

👉 do → did  
👉 drink → drank  
👉 eat → ate  
👉 go → went  
👉 have → had  
👉 run → ran

**Examples:**

👉 I ate breakfast early.  
👉 They went to the park.  
👉 He sang beautifully.

---

### 🔹 Verb “Be” in Simple Past

• Two forms: **was** and **were**  
• **Was** → I, he, she, it  
• **Were** → you, we, they

**Examples:**

👉 I was cold yesterday afternoon.  
👉 My dog was hungry.  
👉 They were happy after the trip.

## 📝 Past Progressive Tense (Past Continuous Tense)

The Past Progressive Tense describes an action that was happening (in progress) at a particular time in the past.

---

## ✅ Formula

| Subject           | Helping Verb | Main Verb     | Example             |
|------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------------|
| I / He / She / It | was          | Verb + ing   | She was reading.   |

## Usage (When to Use Past Progressive)

1. To show an action that was happening at a specific time in the past  
👉 At 8 PM yesterday, I was watching TV.

2. To describe two long actions happening at the same time in the past  
👉 While I was studying, my brother was playing games.

3. To describe an interrupted action (one action in progress when another happened)  
👉 I was walking to school when it started raining.

4. To set the scene in a story  
👉 The sun was shining, and the birds were singing.

## ⚖️ Comparison with Simple Past Tense

👉 The Simple Past shows completed actions at a specific time (e.g., I called my friend at 9 PM).  
👉 For short, finished actions → use Simple Past (e.g., I talked to my friend).  
👉 For actions happening alongside another, use Past Progressive (e.g., I was watching TV when.).

### 🔹 Past Progressive Emphasizes Long Actions

• The Past Progressive highlights that an action continued for some time in the past.

**Example:**

👉 Simple Past: She cooked dinner. (completed)  
👉 Past Progressive: She was cooking dinner. (ongoing)

---

### 🔹 Past Progressive and Interrupted Actions

• Used when a short past action interrupts a longer ongoing past action.  
👉 I was reading when the phone rang.

• Also used for two long past actions happening at the same time.  
👉 While I was studying, my brother was playing outside.

• Time Marker: **while** is commonly used for simultaneous actions.

### 🔹 Understanding Clauses

• An Independent Clause can stand alone; it is a complete sentence with a subject and verb.  
👉 “I was watching TV.”

• A Dependent Clause cannot stand alone and needs an independent clause to complete its meaning.  
👉 “When the power went out.”

---

### Clause Order Rules

• The order of clauses does not change the meaning.  
• If the dependent clause comes first, use a comma.

---

**Examples:**

👉 “I was watching TV when the power went out.”  
   “When the power went out, I was watching TV.”

👉 “While he was walking, it started raining.”  
   “It started raining while he was walking.”
